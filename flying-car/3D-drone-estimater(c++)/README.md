### Step 1: Sensor Noise ###

For the controls project, the simulator was working with a perfect set of sensors, meaning none of the sensors had any noise.  The first step to adding additional realism to the problem, and developing an estimator, is adding noise to the quad's sensors. For the first step, we will collect some simulated noisy sensor data and estimate the standard deviation of the quad's sensor.

1. Choose scenario `06_NoisySensors`. After running this scenario, the graphs will be recorded to the following csv files with headers: `config/log/Graph1.txt` (GPS X data) and `config/log/Graph2.txt` (Accelerometer X data).

2. Process the logged files to figure out the standard deviation of the the GPS X signal and the IMU Accelerometer X signal.
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pos = pd.read_csv('config/log/Graph1.txt').iloc[:,1]
accel = pd.read_csv('config/log/Graph2.txt').iloc[:,1]
pos_std, accel_std = np.std(pos), np.std(accel)
print('Set MeasuredStdDev_GPSPosXY to {0:.1f} and MeasuredStdDev_AccelXY to {1:.1f}'.format(pos_std, accel_std))
```
- [Out]: Set MeasuredStdDev_GPSPosXY to 0.7 and MeasuredStdDev_AccelXY to 0.5  

3. Plug in the result into the top of `config/6_Sensornoise.txt`.  Specially, set the values for `MeasuredStdDev_GPSPosXY` and `MeasuredStdDev_AccelXY` to be the values you have calculated.
```
MeasuredStdDev_GPSPosXY = 0.7
MeasuredStdDev_AccelXY = 0.5
```


### Step 2: Attitude Estimation ###

In this step, we improves the complementary filter-type attitude filter with a better rate gyro attitude integration scheme.

1. Run scenario `07_AttitudeEstimation`.  For this simulation, the only sensor used is the IMU and noise levels are set to 0 (see `config/07_AttitudeEstimation.txt` for all the settings for this simulation).  There are two plots visible in this simulation.
   - The top graph is showing errors in each of the estimated Euler angles.
   - The bottom shows the true Euler angles and the estimates.
Observe that there’s quite a bit of error in attitude estimation.

2. Change [QuadEstimatorEKF::UpdateFromIMU()](QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp#L74-L115) from line 74 to 115 to nonlinear complementary filter. 

![attitude example](images/attitude-screenshot.png)

In the screenshot above the attitude estimation using linear scheme (left) and using the improved nonlinear scheme (right). Note that Y axis on error is much greater on left.

***Success criteria:*** *Your attitude estimator needs to get within 0.1 rad for each of the Euler angles for at least 3 seconds.*


### Step 3: Prediction Step ###

In this next step, implement the prediction step of your filter.


1. Run scenario `08_PredictState`.  This scenario is configured to use a perfect IMU (only an IMU). Due to the sensitivity of double-integration to attitude errors, we've made the accelerometer update very insignificant (`QuadEstimatorEKF.attitudeTau = 100`).  The plots on this simulation show element of your estimated state and that of the true state.  At the moment you should see that your estimated state does not follow the true state.

2. Implement the state prediction step in the [QuadEstimatorEKF::PredictState()](QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp#L140-L174) from line 140 to 174. If you do it correctly, when you run scenario `08_PredictState` you should see the estimator state track the actual state, with only reasonably slow drift, as shown in the figure below:

![predict drift](images/predict-slow-drift.png)

3. Now let's introduce a realistic IMU, one with noise.  Run scenario `09_PredictionCov`. You will see a small fleet of quadcopter all using your prediction code to integrate forward. You will see two plots:
   - The top graph shows 10 (prediction-only) position X estimates
   - The bottom graph shows 10 (prediction-only) velocity estimates
You will notice however that the estimated covariance (white bounds) currently do not capture the growing errors.

4. In `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp`, calculate the partial derivative of the body-to-global rotation matrix in the function [QuadEstimatorEKF::GetRbgPrime()](QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp#L176-L205) from line 176 to 205.  Once you have that function implement, implement the rest of the prediction step (predict the state covariance forward) in [QuadEstimatorEKF::Predict()](QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp#L207-L257) from line 207 to 257.

5. Run your covariance prediction and tune the `QPosXYStd` and the `QVelXYStd` process parameters in `QuadEstimatorEKF.txt` to try to capture the magnitude of the error you see. 
```
QPosXYStd = 0.01
QVelXYStd = .15
```
A good solution looks as follows:

![good covariance](images/predict-good-cov.png)

Looking at this result, you can see that in the first part of the plot, our covariance (the white line) grows very much like the data.

If we look at an example with a `QPosXYStd` that is much too high (shown below), we can see that the covariance no longer grows in the same way as the data.

![bad x covariance](images/bad-x-sigma.PNG)

Another set of bad examples is shown below for having a `QVelXYStd` too large (first) and too small (second).  As you can see, once again, our covariances in these cases no longer model the data well.

![bad vx cov small](images/bad-vx-sigma-low.PNG)

***Success criteria:*** *This step doesn't have any specific measurable criteria being checked.*


### Step 4: Magnetometer Update ###

Up until now we've only used the accelerometer and gyro for our state estimation.  In this step, you will be adding the information from the magnetometer to improve your filter's performance in estimating the vehicle's heading.

1. Run scenario `10_MagUpdate`.  This scenario uses a realistic IMU, but the magnetometer update hasn’t been implemented yet. As a result, you will notice that the estimate yaw is drifting away from the real value (and the estimated standard deviation is also increasing).  Note that in this case the plot is showing you the estimated yaw error (`quad.est.e.yaw`), which is drifting away from zero as the simulation runs.  You should also see the estimated standard deviation of that state (white boundary) is also increasing.

2. Tune the parameter `QYawStd` (`QuadEstimatorEKF.txt`) for the QuadEstimatorEKF so that it approximately captures the magnitude of the drift, as demonstrated here:
```
QYawStd = .1
```

![mag drift](images/mag-drift.png)

3. Implement magnetometer update in the function [QuadEstimatorEKF::UpdateFromMag()](QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp#L294-L318) from line 294 to 318.  Once completed, you should see a resulting plot similar to this one:

![mag good](images/mag-good-solution.png)

***Success criteria:*** *Your goal is to both have an estimated standard deviation that accurately captures the error and maintain an error of less than 0.1rad in heading for at least 10 seconds of the simulation.*

### Step 5: Closed Loop + GPS Update ###

1. Run scenario `11_GPSUpdate`.  At the moment this scenario is using both an ideal estimator and and ideal IMU.  Even with these ideal elements, watch the position and velocity errors (bottom right). As you see they are drifting away, since GPS update is not yet implemented.

2. Let's change to using your estimator by setting `Quad.UseIdealEstimator` to 0 in `config/11_GPSUpdate.txt`.  Rerun the scenario to get an idea of how well your estimator work with an ideal IMU.

3. Now repeat with realistic IMU by commenting out these lines in `config/11_GPSUpdate.txt`:
```
#SimIMU.AccelStd = 0,0,0
#SimIMU.GyroStd = 0,0,0
```

4. Tune the process noise model in `QuadEstimatorEKF.txt` to try to approximately capture the error you see with the estimated uncertainty (standard deviation) of the filter.

5. Implement the EKF GPS Update in the function [QuadEstimatorEKF::UpdateFromGPS()](QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp#L259-L292) from line 259 to 292.

6. Now once again re-run the simulation.  Your objective is to complete the entire simulation cycle with estimated position error of < 1m (you’ll see a green box over the bottom graph if you succeed).  You may want to try experimenting with the GPS update parameters to try and get better performance.

***Success criteria:*** *Your objective is to complete the entire simulation cycle with estimated position error of < 1m.*


### Step 6: Adding 3D Drone Controller ###

Up to this point, we have been working with a controller that has been relaxed to work with an estimated state instead of a real state.  So now, you will see how well your controller performs and de-tune your controller accordingly.

1. Replace `QuadController.cpp` with the controller you wrote in the last project.

2. Replace `QuadControlParams.txt` with the control parameters you came up with in the last project.

3. Run scenario `11_GPSUpdate`. If your controller crashes immediately do not panic. Flying from an estimated state (even with ideal sensors) is very different from flying with ideal pose. You may need to de-tune your controller. Decrease the position and velocity gains (we’ve seen about 30% detuning being effective) to stabilize it.  Your goal is to once again complete the entire simulation cycle with an estimated position error of < 1m.

***Success criteria:*** *Your objective is to complete the entire simulation cycle with estimated position error of < 1m.*
